# Contributing to SwapSmith

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

SwapSmith is a voice-activated crypto trading assistant built with Next.js, OpenAI, and SideShift.ai. We welcome contributions from the community to help make cross-chain swaps easier and more accessible.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

To get started with local development, follow these steps:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/swapsmith.git](https://github.com/your-username/swapsmith.git)
    cd swapsmith
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    We use `npm` for package management. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Setup**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the example provided:

    Run the local development server:
